# TechLadderIO

## About

This project was started as the TypeScript progression ladder (TSPL):

> The TypeScript progression ladder (TSPL) is a grouping of concepts and skills relevant to TypeScript programming. > TSPL provides aspiring TypeScript programmers with a way to track and improve their TypeScript skills.

However, one of the most recurrent initial pieces of feedback is that people would like to see a similar concept for other programming languages and technologies. The project was then extended to support an unlimited number of technologies. and rhe original GItHub repository was renamed from `TSPL` to TechLadderIO.
